This directory contains React components used throughout the application:

- **ActionButtons.js**: Implements action buttons for editing, deleting, and toggling visibility of items.
- **EditProductModal.js**: Provides a modal for editing product details.
- **InventoryStats.js**: Displays statistics related to inventory, such as total products, total store value, out-of-stock items, and distinct quantities.
- **Navbar.js**: Implements a navigation bar for switching between user and admin views.
- **Product.js**: Represents a single product item with its details and associated action buttons.
- **ProductList.js**: Displays a list of products fetched from the Redux store, utilizing the Product component.

### `src/redux`

This directory contains Redux-related logic:

- **inventorySlice.js**: Manages inventory-related state, including fetching inventory data asynchronously, deleting products, updating products, and toggling product visibility.

### `src/services`

This directory contains service functions for making API calls:

- **api.js**: Handles API calls to fetch inventory data from an external source.

### `src/styles`

This directory contains SCSS files for styling the views:

- **Views.scss**: Defines styles for the views, including the admin container, product table, dialog, buttons, and action icons.

### `src/utils`

This directory contains utility functions:

- **helpers.js**: Provides utility functions for calculating statistics related to inventory, such as total store value, out-of-stock items, distinct quantities, and total products.

### `src/views`

This directory contains the main entry point of the application:

- **App.js**: Serves as the main entry point of the application, rendering the Navbar, InventoryStats, and ProductList components and managing state related to view mode and data fetching.
